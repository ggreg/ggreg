- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ggreg

I work as a software engineer and also like to code for fun. My first computer was an Atari 800.
I wrote my first program in Basic on a [Thomson MO6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_MO6) computer and enjoyed programming in [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) in the 80's.
Then I got an Atari ST and discovered more complex games and programs. I was interested in indie game and demos.

After working in computer security at large ISP, kernel programming and systems programming for a cloud service, founding engineer at a ML startup and at a web analytics startup, and in the [Presto](https://prestodb.io) (also known as [Trino](https://trino.io) after Presto's creators left) team at Meta, I now work on observability at Airtable.

Historically my main programming languages have been Python and C/C++. I've done a decent amount of programming in Go, TypeScript, Java, and Haskell. I'm learning Rust and writing a bunch of tools, a compiler (implementing https://craftinginterpreters.com/ in Rust), and a database.

When not at a computer I enjoy running, rock climbing, paying music, reading about math and science, cooking, and spending time with my family.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in systems programming: database implementation, compilers, distributed systems, workflow engines, and operating systems. I like to understand how hardware works and be mindful about mechanial sympathy. I enjoy making efficient and performant systems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust.
